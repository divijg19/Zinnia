Notes:
- Vendored to unify Node/Vercel serverless integration, cache headers, and testing.
- Local changes: API adapter under `api/`, CDN-friendly Cache-Control, type-check limited to Node-compatible sources.

Sync strategy:
- Manually compare with upstream and cherry-pick fixes/features as needed.
